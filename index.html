        <strong>Virat kohli</strong><b><i> - (Born 5 November 1988)</i></b> is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team.<hr><i><b> <center><p style="color: rgb(2, 2, 74); font-size: 40px;"> He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-fast bowler.</p></center></b></i><p style="font-size: 22px;"><u> He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket.</u><mark> Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.</mark>He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the <del>fifth</del> fourth-highest in international cricket.He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the Cricket World Cup<sub>2011</sub>, ICC Champions Trophy<sub>2013</sub>, and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in <b>2017</b>, <b>2018</b>, and <b>2019</b>.bat.
        <mark>Virat Kohli (Royal Challengers Bengaluru)</mark> <sup>became the first Indian to reach <b>12,000</b> runs in T20s, and the first player to score <b>1,000</b> runs against Chennai Super Kings in the IPL.</sup></p><br><b><p style="font-size: 22px;">'You won't see me for a while' – Virat Kohli hints at post-retirement plans.</b><br>The 35-year-old India batter has been a formidable force, a match-winner, and a game-changer for India over the last decade. Since his international debut in <b>2008</b> in an ODI game against Sri Lanka at Dambulla, Kohli has featured in <b>113</b> Tests, <b>292</b> ODIs, and <b>117</b> T20Is.Kohli is showing no sign of slowing down – he's in tremendous form in the ongoing IPL, sitting atop the run charts with 661 runs in <b>13</b> innings at <b>66.10.</b>
        During a recent gala dinner hosted by Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore team, a significant question was raised to the batting stalwart regarding his retirement plans and the motivations behind his drive to score.<mark>"It's quite simple," Kohli told RCB. "I think as a sportsman, we do have an end-date to our careers. So I am just working backwards. I don't want to finish my career thinking 'oh, what if I have done this on that particular day' because I can't keep going on and on forever.“So it's just about not leaving any undone business behind and not have any regrets later, which I am sure I won't.""Once I am done, I will be gone, you won't see me for a while (smiles). So I want to give it everything I have till the time I play, and that's the only thing that keeps me going," he said.</mark>Kohli is set to feature in the upcoming ICC Men’s T<sub>20</sub> World Cup <b>2024</b> in West Indies and USA, marking his sixth consecutive appearance in the tournament.He holds the record for most runs in the history of Men’s T<sub>20</sub> World Cups, leading the list with <b>1141</b> runs. Given Kohli's current form, he could elevate that tally further.</p>
